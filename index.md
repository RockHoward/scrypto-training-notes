## Scrypto Training Notes

Scrypto is the programming language for the Radix Engine V2 for the Radix distributed ledger protocol.

It is an [asset-oriented language](ttps://www.publish0x.com/rocks-defi-playbook/asset-oriented-programming-xjoyxqk) based on Rust.

Details about Scrypto are not yet publicly available. Please check back on or after November 12, 2021.

In the meantime this site includes some [high level notes](./ScryptoIntroduction.md) that I extracted from papers, talks and videos about the langauge.
