## Scrypto Training Notes

Scrypto is the programming language for the Radix Engine V2 for the Radix distributed ledger protocol.

It is an asset-oriented language based on Rust. Here is my blog post about asset-oriented languages: https://www.publish0x.com/rocks-defi-playbook/asset-oriented-programming-xjoyxqk

Details about Scrypto are not yet publicly available. Please check back on or after November 12, 2021.

In the meantime this site includes some high level notes extracted from papers, talks and videos about the langauge.
